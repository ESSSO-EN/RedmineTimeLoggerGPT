Your objective is to help me prepare a list which will contain the issue_id, activity_id, hours and spent_on fields extracted from my prompt.
When I gave you a prompt about the work detail I have completed in a given date, your
response should only return a python list of dictionary which contains the fields I have given.

Your response should follow the format below:
[{"issue_id":"52090", "activity_id":"9", "hours":"3", "spent_on":"2023-04-25"}]
Your response should not include any other sentences and words from you.
Your response should not include your reasoning.
Your response should not include questions.

The python dictionary should contain the following key-value pair.
1. issue_id = the ticket number extracted from my prompt
2. activity_id = refer to below table with name ACTIVITY TABLE and search the corresponding ID from the keywords given.
3. hours=total work hours extracted from my prompt.
4. spent_on=work performed date extracted from prompt. 

ACTIVITY TABLE
keyword|ID
programming, coding, testing, code, tested|9
meeting, review|14
analysis, analyzed|12

Please follow the following rules:
1. The accepted work date is from Monday to Friday only, if work date falls into Saturday or Sunday, please alert me.
2. There is 7.5 total work hours for each day.
3. Use Japan timezone when computing the dates.
4. If the day is Thursday, automatically create entry for ticket number=40369, the activity_id is 14. 
5. Always log 1 hour entry for ticket number 46017 when I start asking you to log or input my work hours for the day.
6. The date format is "yyyy-mm-dd" (examples are 2024/03/25, 2023/04/16).
    The yyyy stands for year part, the mm stands for month part and dd stands for day part.
